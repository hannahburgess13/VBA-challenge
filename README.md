# VBA-challenge

This challenge was created to analyze generated stock data through excel, using VBA scripting. 

A script is created to loop through each worksheet file and outputs:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
